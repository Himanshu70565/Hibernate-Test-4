Problem with JDBC : 

1. We have to write a lot of boilerplate code for even doing a simple operation.
2. Also Portability is issue with JDBC becuase we have to change our sql statement for different vendors like mysql,sql.
   Also the command for linux is differnet from windows. 

Advantages with Hibernate : 
1.We have a concept of Lazy loading and Eager fetching which is very useful when the data size is in large quantity.for ex : 
  if we just want to find all department id without fetching the employee information,then we can do it easily here.	
2.Reduce a lot of boilerplate code.
3.We can manage transactional management as a cross cutting concern with the help of framework like aspectj when we integrate
  spring framework with hibernate. 
4.The query written is database independent unlike jdbc we just have to change the dialect in our hibernate configuration file.

But still if we want to use the jdbc query in our hibernate code we can still go for it.
